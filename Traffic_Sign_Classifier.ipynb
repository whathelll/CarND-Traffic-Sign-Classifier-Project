If additional code is required that cannot be included in the notebook, be sure that the Python code is successfully imported and included in your submission, if necessary.

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",
